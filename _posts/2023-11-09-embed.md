Today we graduated from the first batch of Conviction's [Embed accelerator](https://www.conviction.com/why-embed.html) among twelve other AI-native builder teams. 

It felt indeed as the article above mentioned: We're creating a Schelling Point, a way for people who want to be on the frontier of AI to find one another easily. It's as if you put a sign in New York City that said, 'Oregon Trail Caravans, This Way'.

It felt great to be surrounded by peers, each with their own version of what the world should look like, buliding with Conviction. Chatting with all the guest speakers in casual setting made you feel like the journey of building a great company is not far away at all.

There has never been a better time to start a startup. We will cherish the comradery and all the learnings forever.
